# Advanced Data Management with PostgreSQL for D326(WGU) - Video Included

## The goal of this project
- To emulate the position and process of a data analyst. This is transforming data so it can be used for analysis and so this data can be presented and understood by non-technical users.
- Choose business question to analyze, create tables and queries to use as a business report
- Write my own SQL functions, triggers and stored procedures
- Present SQL queries used and findings via Panopto



## Overview
This project analyzes **DVD rental data** using PostgreSQL to identify poor-performing movies. The goal is to **optimize inventory and improve business insights** by automating SQL reporting. For more context, check out pdf report.


## Features
- Created **detailed and summary tables** to track movie rental performance.
- Developed **user-defined functions** for data transformation (`rental_rate` categorization, `days_since_rental` calculation).
- Implemented **triggers** to update summary reports automatically.
- Designed **stored procedures** to refresh data efficiently.
